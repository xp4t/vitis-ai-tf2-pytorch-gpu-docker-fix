# Vitis AI TensorFlow 2 GPU Docker Build Fix

This repository provides a verified fix for the **403 Forbidden error** and subsequent **multi-download failure** during the TensorFlow 2 Docker image build in **Vitis AI GPU environments**.

---

## üß© Background

When building the TensorFlow 2 Docker image in Vitis AI, the process frequently fails during Conda environment setup with the following error:

```
RuntimeError: Multi-download failed.
Unable to retrieve repodata (response: 403) for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/linux-64/repodata.json
```

This occurs because the default **Anaconda `repo.anaconda.com`** channels have restricted access. The Docker build tries to pull packages from these blocked URLs, causing the entire build to fail.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Changes Made

| Location                 | Lines | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU path**             | 29‚Äì31 | Removed the default channel and explicitly added `conda-forge` before the VAI channel |
| **ROCm path**            | 56‚Äì59 | Removed the default channel and explicitly added `conda-forge`                        |
| **ROCm install command** | 62    | Removed `-c defaults` from the `mamba install` command                                |
| **GPU path (else)**      | 78‚Äì81 | Removed default channel and explicitly added `conda-forge`                            |
| **GPU install command**  | 85    | Removed `-c defaults` from the `mamba install` command                                |

These edits completely remove references to the restricted **Anaconda main and R** repositories, relying instead on **conda-forge** and your **local channel**.

---

## üß† Root Cause

The issue originated from lines in the build process such as:

```bash
mamba install --no-update-deps -y pydot pyyaml jupyter ipywidgets dill progressbar2 pytest pandas matplotlib pillow -c file:///scratch/conda-channel -c conda-forge -c defaults
```

The inclusion of `-c defaults` forces `mamba` to contact Anaconda‚Äôs servers (`repo.anaconda.com`), which are often restricted. This leads to the **403 Forbidden** response and `Multi-download failed` error.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixed Version Example

After the fix, all `mamba` commands should look like this:

```bash
mamba install --no-update-deps -y pydot pyyaml jupyter ipywidgets dill progressbar2 pytest pandas matplotlib pillow \
    -c file:///scratch/conda-channel -c conda-forge
```

This ensures that the build process:

* Uses only `conda-forge` and local channels.
* Avoids any contact with `repo.anaconda.com`.
* Works for CPU, ROCm, and CUDA-based TensorFlow 2 images.

---

## üß± Example Build Error (Before Fix)

```
1049.4 RuntimeError: Multi-download failed.
Unable to retrieve repodata (response: 403) for https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/linux-64/repodata.json
...
ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/bash -c if [[ -n \"${TARGET_FRAMEWORK}\" ]]; then  bash ./install_${TARGET_FRAMEWORK}.sh; fi" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

After applying the fix, the error no longer occurs, and the Docker image builds successfully.

---

## üöÄ Usage

Clone and build the fixed image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vitis-ai-tf2-docker-fix.git
cd vitis-ai-tf2-docker-fix
docker build -t vitis-ai-tf2-fixed .
```

Run it with GPU support:

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all vitis-ai-tf2-fixed
```

---

## üßæ Summary

* Removed all access to `repo.anaconda.com`.
* Added `conda-forge` and local channel explicitly.
* Works across CPU, ROCm, and GPU builds.
* Verified fix for TensorFlow 2 path on Vitis AI.
